#Pizza Store Sales Optimization Project

##Project Overview
This project focuses on optimizing a pizza store's sales by leveraging SQL to analyze and derive insights from the sales data. The goal is to address key challenges related to order tracking, revenue management, product pricing, and customer preferences to enhance business growth and operational efficiency.

##Key Problems Solved
Inefficient Order Tracking: Implemented SQL queries to retrieve and analyze the total number of orders placed, providing a clear view of sales volume and business growth.
Revenue Management: Developed accurate SQL-based calculations for total revenue generated from pizza sales, aiding in financial planning and performance assessment.
Product Pricing: Identified the highest-priced pizza and analyzed its impact on sales through specific SQL queries to refine pricing strategies.
Customer Preferences: Analyzed the most commonly ordered pizza sizes and types using SQL queries to tailor offerings to customer preferences.
Category Analysis: Performed category-wise analysis to understand the distribution and performance of each pizza category.

##Important SQL Queries

###Total Number of Orders
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_orders FROM orders;

###Total Revenue Calculation
SELECT SUM(price * quantity) AS total_revenue FROM order_details;

###Highest-Priced Pizza Identification
SELECT pizza_name, MAX(price) AS highest_price FROM pizzas;

###Most Common Pizza Size Ordered
SELECT size, COUNT(*) AS order_count
FROM order_details
GROUP BY size
ORDER BY order_count DESC
LIMIT 1;

###Top 5 Most Ordered Pizza Types
SELECT pizza_name, COUNT(*) AS order_count
FROM order_details
GROUP BY pizza_name
ORDER BY order_count DESC
LIMIT 5;
